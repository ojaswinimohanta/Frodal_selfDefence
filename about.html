				<p>
					Knowing how to protect yourself from a potential attacker is a skill set all of us should have in
					our toolbox. Mastering the steps necessary to identify a dangerous situation and ward off an
					attacker is at the core of self-defense classes.

					Most traditional self-defense lessons are designed to teach everything from basic level
					de-escalation skills to full, physical combat techniques. Although in-person instruction is ideal,
					you can still learn many valuable self-defense techniques at home. So, if you’re ready to learn how
					to assess your surroundings, identify danger, and know what to do when confronted with a threat,
					we’ve got you covered.

					This roundup includes online self-defense classes and programs from expert-trained instructors that
					feature strategies appropriate for all ages and levels.
				<p> A person can save herself in many ways
					(not only through self-defence)<br>
					EX:1.When you are being attacked in a hotel room,buildings,theatres,malls etc, You can yell as
					"Fire"
					It can attract people's attention and you may be helped.<br>
					2.If Someone is visbally attacking you that's too a crime or assault.So,you can just report them if
					not
					youcan just walk away,go back and if still you feel like there's going to be something wrong, you
					can
					self-defenec inorder to save yourself.</p>
				<p>3.Hitting Somebody too is assault so one can report it,if the person is Continously
					hitting,you can too just hit back and it would be self self-defence.<br>
					There are few accessovices which promotes safety for Women:<br>
					1.knife,keychains<br>
					2.paper Spray,person<br>
					3.stew Gums<br>
					Learning self-defence skills benifits women in many ways.They Have to be taught Both the Physical
					and verbal resistance to rape.
