        "Any act done in self-defence is not an offense   "
        Self defense helps to prepare you for Unexpected situations.
        By leaving the basic self self-defence techniques one can protect themself,whichmakes them
        more stronger and will be more self-confident.
    </p>
    <p>
        A person can save herself in many ways (not only through self-defence)
        EX:When you are being attacked in a hotel room,buildings,theatres,malls etc, You can yell as "Fire"
        It can  attract people's attention and you may be helped.<br>
        And if Someone is visbally attacking you that's too a crime or assault.So,you can just report them if not
        youcan just walk away,go back and if still you feel like there's going to be something wrong, you can 
        self-defenec in ovdol to save yourself.

    </p>
    <p>Hitting Somebody too is assault so one can report it,if the person is Continously
        hitting you,you can too just hit back and it would be self self-defence.<br>
        There are few accessovices which promotes safety for Women:<br>
        1.knife,keychains<br>
        2.paper Spray,person<br>
        3.stew Gums<br>
        Leaving self-defence skills benifits women in many ways.They Have to be taught Both the Physical and verbal resistance to rape.
    </p>
    <p>
        Self-defence is very important because you need to save yourself during the particular
        situation, you can't wait for Somebody to Save You.<br>
        The number of cases ,aisaults will become less ,when only women can self-defend.<br>
        you/Parents do not need to teach their daughter  how to choose what to do,when not to, and how and what to does Up.
        The only thing they have to do is -to give them the confidence and make or motivate them to be self-defensives.<br>
        A place like india whose womwn going on roads & at their home who don't have sefety need to know  and learn self-defense.
